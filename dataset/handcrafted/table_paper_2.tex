\toprule
\textbf{Tool} & \textbf{Analyzes} & \textbf{Supported Input} & \textbf{Techniques} & \textbf{Reentrancy Detection Criteria} \\
\midrule
CCC & Source & Solidity source & Pattern-based queries & Detects reentrancy if an external \texttt{CALL}-like instruction occurs before a state update, with the call target influenced by user input and without explicit safeguards. Detects single-function reentrancy. \\
\addlinespace
ConFuzzius & Bytecode & Solidity (via compilation) and EVM bytecode & Symbolic execution with gas and value constraints & Detects reentrancy if a \texttt{CALL} with $>$2,300 gas, non-zero or symbolic value, and symbolic target occurs with a preceding \texttt{SLOAD} and a following \texttt{SSTORE} on the same storage slot. Adds constraints on gas, value, and symbolic target. Excludes constant zero-value calls. Detects single and cross-function reentrancy. \\
\addlinespace
Conkas & Bytecode & Solidity (via compilation) and EVM bytecode & Symbolic execution with SMT solving (Z3) & Detects reentrancy if an \texttt{SSTORE} occurs after a \texttt{CALL}, with the stored value dependent on a preceding \texttt{SLOAD}. Uses Z3 to solve constraints. Supports Solidity $\leq$0.6.11. Detects single-function reentrancy. \\
\addlinespace
eThor & Bytecode & EVM bytecode & Symbolic execution with reentrancy state tracking & Detects reentrancy if, after a contract is reentered, further \texttt{CALL} instructions can still occur, violating single-entrancy. Detects single and cross-function reentrancy, and some cross-contract cases if they manifest as reentry into the same contract. \\
\addlinespace
Manticore & Bytecode & EVM bytecode & Symbolic execution with attacker modeling & Detects reentrancy if a \texttt{CALL} succeeds with $>$2,300 gas to an attacker address, followed by an \texttt{SSTORE} whose slot affects control flow. Adds constraints on gas and attacker address. Detects single and cross-function reentrancy (some cross-contract cases depending on scope). \\
\addlinespace
Mythril & Bytecode & Solidity (via compilation) and EVM bytecode & Symbolic execution with taint analysis & Detects reentrancy if a \texttt{CALL}, \texttt{DELEGATECALL}, or \texttt{CALLCODE} with $>$2,300 gas to a symbolic or dynamic target is followed by state access (\texttt{SLOAD}, \texttt{SSTORE}, \texttt{CREATE}, or \texttt{CREATE2}), considering even state reads as risky. Adds constraints on call type and gas. Detects single and cross-function reentrancy (some cross-contract cases depending on scope). \\
\addlinespace
Oyente & Bytecode & EVM bytecode & Symbolic execution & Detects reentrancy if an \texttt{SSTORE} occurs after a \texttt{CALL} or \texttt{CALLCODE} on a feasible execution path. Detects single-function reentrancy. \\
\addlinespace
Securify & Bytecode & EVM bytecode & Pattern-based queries & Detects reentrancy if an external \texttt{CALL} (excluding constant zero-value and gas-independent calls) is followed by an \texttt{SSTORE}. Detects single-function reentrancy. \\
\addlinespace
Securify2 & Source & Solidity source & Pattern-based queries with compliance and violation patterns & Detects reentrancy if an external \texttt{CALL} occurs before a state update, using compliance and violation patterns. Detects single and cross-function reentrancy. \\
\addlinespace
Semgrep & Source & Solidity source & Pattern-based queries & Does not detect reentrancy; only matches specific ERC-related \texttt{CALL} patterns, not general reentrancy cases. Detects only single-function reentrancy. \\
\addlinespace
sFuzz & Dynamic (fuzzing) & Solidity source (up to 0.4.x) & Dynamic fuzz testing with attacker contracts & Detects reentrancy if a fuzzed attacker contract can reenter via the fallback function before a state update. Supports Solidity $\leq$0.4.x. Detects single-function reentrancy. \\
\addlinespace
Slither & Source & Solidity source & Static analysis with pattern matching & Detects reentrancy if an external \texttt{CALL} is followed by a state update. Detects single-function reentrancy. \\
\addlinespace
SmartCheck & Source & Solidity source & Pattern-based queries & Does not detect reentrancy; no explicit reentrancy detection rules implemented. Detects only single-function reentrancy (if at all). \\
\addlinespace
Solhint & Source & Solidity source & Heuristic warnings on low-level calls & Does not detect reentrancy; only warns on risky low-level calls such as \texttt{call.value()} or \texttt{call}. Detects only simple single-function cases indirectly. \\
\addlinespace
teEther & Bytecode & EVM bytecode & Symbolic execution with exploit generation & Detects reentrancy if symbolic execution can generate an exploit where a \texttt{CALL} can reenter before a state update. Detects single and cross-function reentrancy (and some cross-contract cases, depending on scope). \\
\addlinespace
Vandal & Bytecode & EVM bytecode & Abstract interpretation & Detects reentrancy if an external \texttt{CALL} is followed by a state update without a mutex. Detects single and cross-function reentrancy. \\
