In this document we recap for each existing analyzer tool what kind of analysis it performs for Reentrancy.

# CCC  
- **Analysis target:** Solidity source code (including incomplete snippets)  
- **Analysis performed on:** Code Property Graph (CPG) generated from source code  
- **Techniques:** Pattern-based analysis expressed as queries on the CPG  
- **Reentrancy detection criterion:** Matches a pattern where the contract makes an external call before completing its state updates, with the call target or value influenced by user input, and without safeguards or mitigating conditions to prevent reentry.  
- **Notes:** None  
- **Reentrancy types detected:** Single-function reentrancy

# ConFuzzius  
- **Analysis target:** EVM bytecode  
- **Analysis performed on:** Bytecode  
- **Techniques:** Combination of syntactic analysis, symbolic execution, SAT solving, and fuzzing  
- **Reentrancy detection criterion:** Detects CALL instructions preceded by SLOADs and followed by SSTOREs on the same storage slot. A call is considered reentrant if:  
  - The gas forwarded is greater than 2300 (must be concrete, non-symbolic)  
  - AND the transferred value is greater than zero or symbolic  
  - AND the call target address is symbolic  
  It is NOT considered reentrant if the value is zero or the address is constant.  
- **Notes:** Supported EVM versions down to 2019 (Petersburg)  
- **Reentrancy types detected:** Single-function and cross-function reentrancy (and some cross-contract cases, depending on analysis scope)
