/*
 * @title A sorted doubly linked list with nodes sorted in descending order. Optionally accepts insert position hints
 *
 * Given a new node with a `key`, a hint is of the form `(prevId, nextId)` s.t. `prevId` and `nextId` are adjacent in the list.
 * `prevId` is a node with a key >= `key` and `nextId` is a node with a key <= `key`. If the sender provides a hint that is a valid insert position
 * the insert operation is a constant time storage write. However, the provided hint in a given transaction might be a valid insert position, but if other transactions are included first, when
 * the given transaction is executed the provided hint may no longer be a valid insert position. For example, one of the nodes referenced might be removed or their keys may
 * be updated such that the the pair of nodes in the hint no longer represent a valid insert position. If one of the nodes in the hint becomes invalid, we still try to use the other
 * valid node as a starting point for finding the appropriate insert position. If both nodes in the hint become invalid, we use the head of the list as a starting point
 * to find the appropriate insert position.
