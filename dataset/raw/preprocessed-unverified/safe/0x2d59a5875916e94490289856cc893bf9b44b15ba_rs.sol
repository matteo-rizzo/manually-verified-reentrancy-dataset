/**
 * Basic trigonometry functions
 *
 * Solidity library offering the functionality of basic trigonometry functions
 * with both input and output being integer approximated.
 *
 * This is useful since:
 * - At the moment no floating/fixed point math can happen in solidity
 * - Should be (?) cheaper than the actual operations using floating point
 *   if and when they are implemented.
 *
 * The implementation is based off Dave Dribin's trigint C library
 * http://www.dribin.org/dave/trigint/
 * Which in turn is based from a now deleted article which can be found in
 * the internet wayback machine:
