 * storage uint8[] types in place. Modular provides smart contract services
 * and security reviews for contract deployments in addition to working on open
 * source projects in the Ethereum community. Our purpose is to test, document,
 * and deploy reusable code onto the blockchain and improve both security and
 * usability. We also educate non-profits, schools, and other community members
 * about the application of blockchain technology.
