(DPOOL) ERC-721 TOKEN

$DPOOL

Each $DPOOL token represents a VIP who like any of us may soon assume room temperature.
$DPOOL tokens are minted and initially sold on the Opensea platform.
If your $DPOOL VIP dies you can claim the current prize pool in the 
DEADPOOL contract.

25% of each intitial sale is added to the DEADPOOL prize pool.
Each (DPOOL) Token is linked to the celebrity name and image.
Website:   https://DEADPOOLNFT.io 
Telegram:  https://t.me/deadpoolnft

- The next winner is the holder of the NFT who dies next
- If there is a tie, such as 2 NFTs die in a plane crash, the lower ID number wins first
- Be sure you have control of the address which holds you NFT
- Prize Winnings are paid out to the ETH address which owns the NFT
- 25% of all initial sales proceeds are added to the prize pool
- Each winner receives 50% of the current prize pool
