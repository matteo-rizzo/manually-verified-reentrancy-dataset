 *   USDX is a USD based stablecoin with the following properties:
 *   - Eth sent to the USDX contract is locked, and USDX is minted
 *     into the sender's account at the current eth/usd exchange rate.
 *   - Locked eth can be unlocked by the original sender by burning USDX
 *     at the originally minted price.
 *
 *   Note: Owner is able to set the eth/usd oracle.
