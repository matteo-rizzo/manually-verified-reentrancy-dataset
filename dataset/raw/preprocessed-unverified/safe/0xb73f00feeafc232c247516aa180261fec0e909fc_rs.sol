/* THE MR MITTENZ MANIFESTO (more of a FAQ, really)
 * 
 *  ))) What is it and what do we believe?
 *
 * Mr Mittenz is an alternative to doge-based coins. We firmly
 * believe that we need to return our pure and humble cat meme
 * origins.
 *
 * ))) What is it really?
 * 
 * It's a memecoin, to start. A joke. A game. A cat-based alternative
 * to doge-based memecoins. But our true motivation is this:
 * We want to create a community---a shared identity. We want to
 * bring together people and start conversations about what to do
 * next. We believe that crypto is going to change our world for the
 * better, and that we're just scratching the surface of what's possible
 * now.
 *
 * ))) How does it work?
 *
 * Fixed supply, 0.01% rule.
 *
 * We read somewhere that there are around 400 million cats in the world,
 * so that's how many Mr Mittenz tokens there are: 400,000,000 Mr Mittenz.
 * Period. The supply is fixed and will stay at 400,000,000 Mr Mittenz forever.
 * To encourage HODLing, each transaction is limited to a maximum size of
 * 40,000 Mr Mittenz, except for transfers out of owner account during setup
 * for the launch as explained below in "What are the initial allocations and
 * the details of the launch?". That is, no single transfer can move more than
 * 0.01% of the total supply of Mr Mittenz.
 *
 * ))) So I can only trade 40,000 Mr Mittenz?
 *
 * That's not what we mean.
 *
 * You can trade as many Mr Mittenz as you want in your life, but you can only
 * trade up to 40,000 Mr Mittenz in a *single transaction*. If you want to
 * trade larger amounts, you will have to do so in multiple transactions.
 * This mechanism is in place to encourage decentralization of ownership and to
 * try to avoid a situation where a small number of big transactions changes the
 * price drastically in a small amount of time. We want to give everyone the
 * same level of influence over the price.
 *
 * ))) What are the initial allocations and the details of the launch?
 *
 * 80% was allocated to the Community Pool and 20% was allocated to the Admin
 * and Rewards Pool. The Admin and Rewards Pool is exactly what it sounds like:
 * It's a pool to reward team members and contributors and to fund expenses
 * and future projects. At setup, the 80% Community Pool was transferred into liquidity
 * pools.
 * 
 * The liquidity pool (LP) tokens were then burned (sent to dead address
 * 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD) so that the Mr Mittenz 
 * added to the liquidity pools cannot be taken back by the setup account
 * and the only way to get Mr Mittenz is to trade.
 *
 *
 *
 * The Admin and Rewards Pool was divided and transferred to addresses
 * without ownership status and therefore subject to the 40,000 Mr Mittenz transaction
 * limit.
 *
 * Ownership of the Mr Mittenz contract was then renounced, so *every single address*
 * is now subject to the 40,000 Mr Mittenz transaction limit---including every Mr Mittenz
 * team member.
 *
 * You can verify these transactions on Etherscan.
 * 
 * ))) What is Mr Mittenz not?
 *
 * This should be pretty obvious, but this is a memecoin---not somewhere
 * you should be putting your retirement money. Mr Mittenz is designed to
 * encourage HODLing (who doesn't like Mittenz for their diamond hands?)
 * and we hope it's successful and becomes the basis for many good things
 * to come, but neither we nor anyone else can guarantee a good outcome.
 * DON'T PUT MONEY INTO MR MITTENZ THAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE. Treat
 * it like a game, or a lottery ticket, and hopefully a chance to be a
 * part of a community.
 * 
 * CONTRACT SOURCE CODE VERIFICATION:
 *
 * ))) Context, Ownable, SafeMath, Address, IERC20, IERC20Metadata, and ERC20 code is taken directly
 *     from OpenZeppelin and is current as of the commit below. The code is included in a single file
 *     for easier verification.
 *     https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/commit/5cd86f740d9a4b351cad196e7957a7d0406e7368
 *
 * ))) This code is available on GitHub to verify the contract.
