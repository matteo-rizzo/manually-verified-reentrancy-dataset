What is VERA?

Vera is for everyone.
    Lending, leasing, or swapping assets you own should be as easy and accessible as sending a text message. 
    That's why Vera provides the fabric to empower developers, creators, consumers, and asset brokers in any NFT financial marketplace that is open and accessible to all.


Our Vision
    To make NFT creation, management, and usage accessible, user-friendly, and decentralized.
