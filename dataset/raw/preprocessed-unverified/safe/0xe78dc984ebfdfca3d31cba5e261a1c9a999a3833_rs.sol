/**
 * The world's lightest blockchain, powered by participants.
 * Other blockchain protocols are so heavy they require intermediaries to run nodes, recreating the same old power dynamics. But Mina is light, so anyone can connect peer-to-peer and quickly sync and verify the chain. Built on a consistent-sized cryptographic proof, the blockchain will stay accessible—even as it scales.
 * Mina is building a gateway between the real world and crypto — and the infrastructure for the secure, democratic future we all deserve.
 * It's Time to Own Our Future! Why did we create the world's lightest blockchain? To rebalance the scales and give anyone with a smartphone the power to participate, build, exchange and thrive.
