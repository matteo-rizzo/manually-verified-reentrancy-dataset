/**
* The floki Inu  - #FINU
* 

* $floki Inu is a token with a twist and have used a similar tokenomics concept as MUSUBI! Check out the Tokenomics! 
* No sale limitations, which benefits whales and little fish alike. 
* An innovative dynamic reflection tax rate which increases proportionate to the size of the sell.

  TOKENOMICS:
* 1,000,000,000,000,000 TOTAL SUPPLY
* * 10% total tax on buy
* Fee on sells is dynamic, relative to price impact, minimum of 10% fee and maximum of 40% fee, with NO SELL LIMIT.
* No team tokens, no presale
* FIRST TWO MINUTES: 3,000,000,000 max buy / 45-second buy cooldown (these limitations are lifted automatically two minutes post-launch)
* 15-second cooldown to sell after a buy, in order to limit bot behavior. NO OTHER COOLDOWNS, NO COOLDOWNS BETWEEN SELLS
* No buy or sell token limits. Whales are welcome!

* A unique approach to resolving the huge dumps after long pumps!
