REENTRANCY_PRINCIPLES = """
When analyzing, apply the following principles diligently:
1.  **Strict CEI Adherence**: The Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern is paramount. If all state changes (Effects) related to an operation are *unconditionally completed before* any external call (Interaction) within that operation's logical flow, this is a strong indicator of safety for that specific interaction path.
2.  **External calls (Interactions)** belong to the following set of primitives: '.call' and any method invocation in Solidity, i.e. any method whose recipient expression (left hand of the dot operator) has a contract or interface type deriving from a type-cast from an address (including the 'this' expression).
3.  **External calls (Interactions)** do NOT belong to the following set of primitives: '.delegatecall', '.staticcall', and '.send' or '.transfer' where the left hand is an address (which is different from other occurrences of '.send' or '.transfer' method names belonging to ERC20 interfaces or other custom interfaces). Event emission (via the 'emit' keyword) are NOT considered interactions.
4.  **Effects** are state modifications, i.e. uses of the assignment operator on state variables as well as external calls (including low-level-call and method invocations) which may modify the state of other contracts whose logic is correlated. Note that the following cases are NOT considered effects: event emissions, requires, asserts, error statements.
5.  **Effective Reentrancy Guards**: Recognize correctly implemented and applied reentrancy guards (e.g., OpenZeppelin's `nonReentrant` modifier, custom mutexes). If a function is protected by such a guard, it should generally be considered safe from re-entering *itself*.
6.  **Plausible Exploit Path**: A classification of "Reentrant" requires a *plausible* scenario where re-entering leads to a tangible harmful outcome. Do not mark as "Reentrant" those code patterns implementing reentrancy guards, mutexes and other protection mechanisms. A "harmful outcome" does not necessarily lead to money theft, but also to contract state inconsistencies that may break the program logic or behaviour.
7.  **Cross-Function Reentrancy** takes place when an external call in a function A of a given contract allows re-entering into one or more functions of the same contract affecting state variables used or modified by A. If A is protected by a reentrancy guard, mutex or other protection mechanism, all other functions involved in possible reentrancy must be protected by the same mechanism.
8. **Cross-Contract Reentrancy** are complex scenarios that take place when an attacker does not re-enter directly into the caller contract or through other functions of the caller contract, but rather leverages the chain of invocations across different contracts, possibly re-entering at some point into the chain and by taking advantage of temporarily inconsistent states to manipulate the control flow or drain resources. 
9.  **Fallback/receive function**: the presence of a fallback (or receive) function in the contract does not imply a reentrancy vulenrability per s√©. They have to be considered ordinary functions that has to be analyzed.
10. Consider a **Modernized Definition for Reentrancy** embracing a wider set of vulnerable scenarios, not only strictly mutual recursive calls. A malicious callee may compromise the intended logic of a contract (or of an interconnected set of contracts) not necessarily by calling back into the original caller, but by invoking alternative functions that modify the shared system state. This premature or unintended state alteration can in turn enable subsequent exploits.
"""

CLASSIFY_EXPLAIN_REQUEST = """
You must follow these steps precisely:

**Analyze and Classify the Contract**:
    * Carefully examine all functions, focusing on external calls and state management, applying the principles above.
    * Classify the contract as **Reentrant** only if you identify a pattern with a *plausible and specific exploit path* leading to a negative outcome, AND this path is not adequately mitigated by correctly implementing CEI, reentrancy guards, or other clear protective logic. This includes:
        * Clear violation of CEI where state is modified *after* an external call, and this can be exploited.
        * Absence or demonstrable flaw in a reentrancy guard on a function that can be re-entered to exploit intermediate state.
        * A credible cross-function reentrancy scenario where shared state is compromised.
    * Classify the contract as **Safe** if:
        * It strictly and demonstrably adheres to the CEI pattern for all interactions involving external calls.
        * Effective reentrancy guards are correctly applied to all relevant functions that might otherwise be vulnerable.
        * Potential cross-function reentrancy paths are blocked by guards, complete state updates, or design that prevents exploitation of shared state.
        * In essence, standard and sound security practices against reentrancy are evident and correctly implemented.
    * The classification **MUST** be one of: 'Reentrant' or 'Safe'. Avoid ambiguity. If a pattern looks suspicious but has robust, standard mitigations correctly applied, err on the side of 'Safe' for that specific pattern, clearly explaining the mitigation.

**Provide a Detailed Explanation**:
    * Your explanation **MUST** be a valid JSON string (special characters like quotes, newlines properly escaped: `\"`, `\\n`).
    * The internal structure of the JSON in the 'explanation' string can be adapted to best describe the specific findings (e.g., `mitigation_found_but_flawed`, `cross_function_scenario_details`).
    * **If classified as 'Reentrant'**:
        * Identify the vulnerable function(s).
        * Cite specific line numbers for the external call and relevant state modifications (effects).
        * **Crucially, describe the specific, plausible attack vector**, explaining *how* re-entrancy would lead to a detrimental outcome.
        * If mitigations are present but flawed or insufficient, explain why they fail.
    * **If classified as 'Safe'**:
        * Identify function(s) that handle external calls or state changes relevant to reentrancy.
        * Clearly explain the specific safeguards that prevent reentrancy.
        * Cite line numbers demonstrating such safeguards. If a pattern might look suspicious at first glance but is safe due to a specific reason, highlight this.

""" + REENTRANCY_PRINCIPLES + """

You must assess the `Explanation Text` based on the following three criteria:

1.  **Correctness**:
    * Definition: This refers to the factual accuracy of the `Explanation Text` in identifying and describing reentrancy vulnerabilities (or confirming their absence) relative to the provided `Solidity Contract Source Code`.
    * Evaluation Points:
        * Does the explanation accurately identify vulnerable functions, external calls, state variables, and their interactions related to reentrancy?
        * Are cited line numbers, function names, and variable names correct?
        * If a vulnerability is claimed, is the described attack vector plausible and technically sound given the code?
        * If safety is claimed, are the described safeguards (e.g., CEI pattern, reentrancy guards) actually present, correctly implemented, and effective as stated?
        * Are there any factual errors, misinterpretations of Solidity logic, or omissions of critical details that affect the reentrancy assessment?

2.  **Informativeness**:
    * Definition: This assesses the extent to which the `Explanation Text` furnishes meaningful, non-trivial insights that could aid a developer or auditor in comprehensively understanding the contract's security posture specifically concerning reentrancy.
    * Evaluation Points:
        * Does the explanation go beyond superficial statements (e.g., merely stating "an external call exists")?
        * Does it clarify *why* a specific pattern is vulnerable or safe in a way that builds understanding?
        * Does it highlight specific nuances of the reentrancy mechanism or protection (e.g., type of reentrancy like cross-function, specific state variables at risk, subtleties of a guard's implementation)?
        * Does it provide context or consequences of the findings that are valuable for remediation or trust?
        * Does it avoid being overly verbose with trivial information while still being comprehensive?

3.  **Pertinence**:
    * Definition: This concerns the relevance and specificity of the information provided in the `Explanation Text` directly to the analysis of reentrancy vulnerabilities (or their absence).
    * Evaluation Points:
        * Is all information presented directly relevant to assessing reentrancy?
        * Does the explanation stay focused on reentrancy, or does it digress into unrelated vulnerabilities (e.g., gas optimization, different attack vectors) unless they directly contribute to or intersect with a reentrancy concern?
        * Is the level of detail appropriate and specific to the reentrancy analysis, without being cluttered by irrelevant code aspects or overly broad statements?
